Ralph is a CLI tool that automates security incident response for AWS resources.

It's the tool you use when this happens:

## Features

Ralph loads and executes a collection of pre-defined runbook to automate incident response.

### EC2 Runbooks

1. Removing IAM Instance Profile - Detaches the current IAM Instance Profile of an instance.

2. Enable Termination Protection - Enables termination protection for an instance. This gives an extra step to prevent accidental termination of an instance.

3. Set Shutdown Behavior to Stop - Setting shutdown behavior to stop guarantees that the shutting down the instance will not result to termination of the instance.

## Installation

To install Ralph using NPM, run:

```lang=bash
$ npm i @lendi/ralph
/usr/local/bin/ralph -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/@lendi/ralph/lib/index.js

## Setup

- Setup your AWS credentials (`~/.aws/credentials`) by following this [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html).

- Add AWS_REGION in your environment variables. Here's an example with AWS_REGION set to "ap-southeast-2":

```lang=bash
$ export AWS_REGION="ap-southeast-2"
...
```

## Usage

### `execute` command

- Runs each of the runbooks on selected AWS instance
- Loads the list of instances available for lock down.

```lang=bash
$ ralph execute
? Which instance do you want to lock down?
  i-00000000000000001 (kafka-instance)
  i-00000000000000002
  i-00000000000000003
‚ùØ i-00000000000000004 (vulnerable-instance)
  i-00000000000000005 (machine-learning-instance)
